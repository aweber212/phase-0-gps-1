What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
	
*I was stuggling with pushes and pulls, not wuite sure of the difference between those and merges. Also, had not experienced the process of resolving a merge conflict. 

What concepts were clarified during the GPS?

*The process of merging branches was definitely clarified after repeatedly practicing a few merges. Also, intentionally going through a merge conflict was very helpful (esp. because my pair and I stuggled with some of the instructions...frustrating at the time, but the troubleshooting process was worth it). 


What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?

*I remember specifically asking them what happens when a file is altered after it is staged, but before it is commited. The guide had us try it with a test file, so that we could both how alterations at different stages of the commit process effected the content to be saved.

What still confuses you about Git?

*I am still unsure about how to retreive previous commits and the range of diff commands. The merge conflict in this assignment was helpful in tinroducing these concepts, but I need to go further to understand more fully. 

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

*It was a pleasant pairing. Alex was very patient and attntive as a partner. We ran into some trouble after our guide left, but we were both dedicated to solving the problem, and we figured it out after much frustration. I'm glad that he stuck with me. A good first pairing.
